# Green-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-with-Capacitated-Alternative-Fuel-Stations
<br> For each node of the network, we report:
<br> ## ID= a unique identifier
<br> # Type: d=depot, c=customer, f=station
<br> Longitude
<br>Latitude
<br> <br> Then, for each pump, we report the occupancy profile expressed through a binary array whose dimension is equal to the number of 30-minutes timeslots. In particular, 0 means that the pump is available. Instead, 1 indicates that the pump is occupied.
<br> <br> For the instances with 5 pumps, we give the pumps availability instead of the occupancy. Same information is given also for the instances with 15 customers and 4 pumps and a clustered customers distribution.
<br> <br>For more details, we refer the readers to the following two works:
